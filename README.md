# Foundry workshop demos

## Deploy and test everything

Requires Python 3.10-3.13 for running all demos (the red-teaming SDK restricts
Python versions), Azure CLI, Bicep (`az bicep version`), and an interactive
Azure user with resource creation and role-assignment permissions. See each
demo's prerequisites for model quota and access requirements.

There are **37 standalone demos**. Prefer selecting a small subset rather than
deploying every resource and running every paid operation at once:

```bash
az login
python3 deploy.py --subscription "<subscription-id>" --demo 14
python3 deploy.py --subscription "<subscription-id>" --demo 20 --demo 25
```

`--demo` accepts a demo number or exact folder name and can be repeated. Selected
demos run in numeric order; prerequisites for unselected demos are not required.
Without `--demo`, the runner selects all 37.
Lab 32 requires a Browser Automation-supported region such as `eastus`, not the
runner's `eastus2` default. The runner rejects unsupported template locations
before any Azure resource changes. Present lab 32 separately using its manual
connection setup instructions; selecting every lab with default settings now
fails that regional check rather than partially provisioning the collection.
Lab 35 additionally needs a tenant-admin-approved Work IQ OAuth application,
Copilot Credits billing and individual user authorization. Its first deployment
without that connection deliberately fails the live phase; complete the
[Work IQ setup](./35-work-iq/README.md) before expecting an end-to-end pass.

Before running **all demos**, complete the tenant setup in
[Entra Agent ID](./12-entra-agent-id/README.md). It requires separate tenant
roles/admin consent and sets `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`, `ENTRA_BLUEPRINT_CLIENT_ID`,
`ENTRA_AGENT_ID`, and `ENTRA_BLUEPRINT_SECRET`. Run the root command from that
same PowerShell session (change back to the repository root). The runner checks
these prerequisites before any Azure changes and passes only the non-secret
agent ID to Bicep. The blueprint secret is not a deployment parameter or output.
Labs 21 and 31 additionally require `AZURE_TENANT_ID` and `SECOND_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`,
an isolated Azure CLI configuration authenticated as a different real user in
the same tenant. The runner invokes each selected lab's `--preflight` after installing
its dependencies but before provider registration or resource creation. Its
README documents the Graph checks; lab 21 also covers optional restricted-group setup.
Labs 23 and 24 require their documented evaluation/publishing permissions and
regional API support. Lab 23's workflow, protected environment, scoped managed
identity, and GitHub OIDC are configured and live-verified in this repository;
other repositories need their own exact subject, environment, and variables.
See its README for owner approval and baseline/regression runs.
Lab 24 uses the documented legacy Agent Application ARM
publishing route and additionally needs subscription Activity Log read access;
read its API/availability caveats before presenting. To present individual demos,
use `--demo` or their standalone deployment instructions.

From the repository root, after that setup:

```bash
az login
python3 deploy.py --subscription "<subscription-id>"
```

If `--subscription` is omitted, the script uses the currently selected Azure CLI
subscription. It does not change that selection. Optional flags:
`--location eastus2`, `--prefix rg-foundry`, and `--principal-id <user-object-id>`
(useful when Microsoft Graph access is restricted).
For templates exposing `searchLocation`, `--search-location` keeps Search in a
separate supported region. Live lab 17 required West US 2 Search because East
US 2 lacked capacity:

```bash
python3 deploy.py --demo 17 --location eastus2 --search-location westus2
```

Keep this override on subsequent deployments to that resource group: Azure
cannot move an existing Search service to another region in place.

### Required workshop tags

Every lab deployment assigns `SecurityControl=Ignore` and
`SecurityExemption=StorageAccountKeyAccess` to its resource group and every
taggable resource, including model deployments and Foundry projects. The
standalone lab scripts preserve their `managedBy` and `lab` ownership tags.
Resource tags are explicit because Azure does not inherit resource-group tags.
Lab 24 also sets both tags under `properties.tags` when creating or updating its
Agent Applications and managed agent deployments at runtime.

Azure does not support resource tags on role assignments, federated identity
credentials, individual Function definitions, Blob services, Blob containers,
Blob lifecycle management policies, and Foundry project connections used by
these templates. Entra directory
objects and data-plane objects are not
ARM-tagged resources. These objects are excluded; their taggable parent resources
receive both tags.

These changes apply on deployment; they do not retroactively update resources
already running in Azure. Redeploy the infrastructure to update existing tags.
The root runner also executes paid live demos, so use a lab's documented
`az group create` and `az deployment group create` commands for infrastructure-only
updates. Tag values must retain the exact casing shown above.

The script:

1. Discovers every immediate demo folder containing `infra/main.bicep` or
   `requirements.txt`, rejecting incomplete folders rather than silently skipping them.
2. Compiles/lints Bicep, creates/reuses each demo's `.venv`, installs its
   requirements, and runs its local unit tests before making Azure changes.
3. Registers the resource providers referenced by the compiled templates and creates a dedicated resource group
   named `<prefix>-<demo-folder-without-number-prefix>-demo` for each demo.
4. Deploys the existing template, passing `principalId` and `location`.
5. Saves deployment outputs to `<demo>/.azure/deployment.json`, maps the `endpoint`
   output plus optional `deployment`, `embeddingDeployment`, `projectEndpoint`, and `toolEndpoint`
   outputs to the demo's environment, and runs `demo.py`.
   Foundry IQ also uses `searchEndpoint`; Entra Agent ID uses `agentIdentityId`.
   Prompt injection uses `contentSafetyEndpoint` for its separate safety classifier.
   Fundamentals uses `deniedEndpoint` for its intentional authorization failure;
   benchmarking uses `alternateDeployment` and `routerDeployment`.
   Tracing uses `applicationInsightsConnectionString`; lifecycle operations use
   `projectResourceId`.
   Lab 27 also maps `searchResourceId`, `storageEndpoint`, and `storageResourceId`
   to `AZURE_SEARCH_RESOURCE_ID`, `AZURE_STORAGE_BLOB_ENDPOINT`, and
   `AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_ID` for its portal-connected Blob knowledge base.
6. Saves live output to `<demo>/.azure/demo.log` and stops with a nonzero exit code
   if any step fails. Newly assigned 403 access errors and 404
   `DeploymentNotFound` errors, plus explicit DNS name-resolution failures, are
   visibly retried at 30-second intervals, up to 11 attempts. Other errors
   (including TLS/certificate errors) fail immediately. Each retry restarts the
   demo, so prompts completed before the error may be sent again and incur charges.

If DNS failures persist, compare the endpoint in `<demo>/.azure/deployment.json`
with the account's endpoints in Azure, then check your local DNS/VPN/network.
A successful ARM deployment does not guarantee the endpoint is immediately
resolvable from your machine. The runner preserves every failed attempt in the
live log and exits nonzero if its retry limit is reached; it does not change
endpoints, bypass certificate validation, or replace failed responses.

**This command creates billable Azure resources, makes live model requests,
runs managed evaluation/red teaming, and submits a paid fine-tuning job.**
Fine-tuning only reports job submission by default; it does not wait for training
to finish. Every rerun submits another training job. Use that demo's `--job-id`
option directly to inspect an existing job instead.
Resources remain deployed for presenting. Rerunning uses the same resource groups
and deployment names and repeats the tests and live calls. The script does not
automatically delete resources on failure. The ignored `.azure` state/logs contain
resource identifiers and demo responses, not API keys or access tokens.
Red-team reports/SDK logs may contain disturbing safety-test text; do not
project raw transcripts or commit them.

To add another demo, use the same folder convention: `infra/main.bicep`,
`requirements.txt`, `demo.py`, and `test_demo.py`. Templates must accept `principalId`
and `location` and expose a string output `endpoint`, plus `deployment` when
using an inference model; Python demos consume `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` when
applicable and the endpoint appropriate to their API, exit
nonzero on failure, and validate the live response. Account-level inference uses
`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`; project APIs use `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` from
`projectEndpoint`; the hosted pricing tool uses `WORKSHOP_TOOL_ENDPOINT` from
`toolEndpoint`. Embeddings use `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT` from
`embeddingDeployment`. Content Safety has no model deployment and consumes its
Cognitive Services URL through the shared endpoint variable. The Decision Model
consumes its Foundry services URL through that variable. Foundry IQ uses
`AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` from `searchEndpoint`; the Entra identity demo receives
`ENTRA_AGENT_ID` from `agentIdentityId` and needs its separate tenant setup.
Fundamentals maps `deniedEndpoint` to `WORKSHOP_DENIED_ENDPOINT`. Benchmarking
maps `alternateDeployment` to `AZURE_OPENAI_ALTERNATE_DEPLOYMENT` and
`routerDeployment` to `AZURE_OPENAI_ROUTER_DEPLOYMENT`. Prompt Shields maps
`contentSafetyEndpoint` to `CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT`.
Tracing maps `applicationInsightsConnectionString` to
`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`; publishing maps `projectResourceId` to
`FOUNDRY_PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID`.
Other output contracts
require updating the runner. Numbered folders are processed in numeric order.
Lab 27 additionally uses `searchResourceId`, `storageEndpoint`, and
`storageResourceId` as documented above, along with the project and embedding outputs.

Each demo has standalone Bicep, local Python code, dependencies, tests, and manual
deployment/cleanup instructions. Generative agent demos use `gpt-4.1-mini` by
default, except WebIQ, which uses `gpt-5-mini`; Model Router and Microsoft Decision
use their own specialized models.
Content Safety needs no model, and semantic caching adds an embedding deployment.
The cache is an application pattern, not a native Foundry cache toggle.
Model access, quota, regional availability, Web Search policy, Toolbox/evaluation/
red-teaming/agentic-retrieval availability, fine-tuning access, and Entra Agent ID
tenant permissions must be checked before presenting. Foundry IQ provisions
Basic Azure AI Search, which has ongoing charges while deployed. The Entra demo
uses a one-day local-development blueprint secret; production should use
managed identity federation/certificates. All included example data is
synthetic/non-sensitive.

Lab 28 requires the preview Foundry Skills API. Its local harness downloads a
pinned skill version and explicitly injects it into a Foundry prompt agent;
it does not deploy a custom hosted application or use automatic skill discovery.

Labs 29-33 extend that introduction with Toolbox/MCP discovery, native Code
Interpreter, managed memory, remote browser automation, and independent skill
release governance. Skills are reusable instructions, not executable tools:
the execution and persistence capabilities come from the respective Foundry tools.
Lab 31 uses the low-level native Memory Store API with explicit injection of
search results into fresh prompt-agent conversations, not an attached auto-writing
memory tool. The Python orchestration/providers still run locally; these labs do not silently
claim hosted-container deployment. Read lab 31's scope/identity requirements and
lab 32's remote-browser/controlled-site setup before selecting them. Browser
submission requires explicit approval and is not enabled by the all-demo runner.
Lab 32's configuration-only preflight requires
`BROWSER_AUTOMATION_CONNECTION_NAME` or `BROWSER_AUTOMATION_PROJECT_CONNECTION_ID`.
Provision its infrastructure and create the manual project-managed-identity
Browser Automation connection before the live step; the runner does not create
that connection. Use `--demo 32 --location eastus` after that setup.
Skills/discovery and memory have preview dependencies; offline tests do not
establish regional API availability. These five labs have not been live-deployed.

Demos 1-7 are intended for short terminal presentations. Managed evaluation and
red teaming can take several minutes; submit fine-tuning ahead of time and show
the existing job during the presentation. Each demo can be deployed and run
independently using its own instructions. See [live test results](./tests.md)
and the [backlog](./BACKLOG.md) for actual service verification and remaining
blockers. Offline tests and template compilation are not proof of live access.

Labs 14-26 extend the feature demonstrations with engineering exercises. Start
with fundamentals and structured outputs, then retrieval, state, tools, tracing,
and evaluation before publishing or advanced identity scenarios. Expected
failures are explicitly labeled; mocked unit-test results are not live service
verification. Approval lab 20 proposes an action by default and never grants
approval automatically. Follow its README to approve or reject the exact proposal.
The CI regression variant in lab 23 is intentionally expected to exit nonzero.
Search and monitoring resources can have ongoing charges while provisioned.

## Test the runner without Azure

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_deploy.py' -v
```

## Remove all lab resource groups

Use [removeAll.sh](./removeAll.sh) with Bash, Azure CLI, and `jq`. Preview first:

```bash
./removeAll.sh --subscription "<subscription-id>"
./removeAll.sh --subscription "<subscription-id>" --execute
```

The script covers all 37 labs: root and standalone runner defaults, documented
manual/historical names, and saved deployment records for the selected subscription.
Legacy output-only `deployment.json` files have no subscription/group metadata;
the script warns and uses known group names instead. Add `--group` if such a
deployment used an unrecorded custom name.
It matches exact names, not broad prefixes, and never changes the Azure CLI's
selected subscription. Repeat for other subscriptions. Use repeated `--prefix`
options for custom runner prefixes or `--group` for unrecorded manual group names.
Names alone are not proof of ownership: review the preview carefully, especially
if a group contains resources unrelated to the workshop.

**Execution now includes irreversible purge, scoped only to workshop groups.**
The preview includes existing soft-deleted Foundry/Cognitive Services accounts and
API Management services, even when their resource groups are already gone.
After deleting groups, the script rediscovers and purges newly soft-deleted
accounts/services, retrying up to six times at ten-second intervals and verifying
their absence. Azure may take additional time to release names.

Log Analytics workspaces are permanently deleted with `--force`. Azure requires
recovering already soft-deleted workspaces first; the script temporarily recreates
their original workshop group if necessary, recovers the workspace, permanently
deletes it, then deletes that group. Recovery/creation happens only with `--execute`.
These permanent-delete operations cannot be undone. Purge can require
subscription-level permissions beyond resource-group deletion permissions.

`--execute` requires typing `DELETE`; add `--yes` for unattended cleanup.
Deletion waits and verifies absence, continues after individual operation failures,
and exits nonzero if any deletion, purge, or verification fails. Resource locks
are not removed. The script handles the lab services with supported purge APIs,
not arbitrary retention stores such as soft-deleted Storage blobs. Local logs/state
and GitHub configuration are retained. See `./removeAll.sh --help` for all options.

**Entra tenant objects aren't deleted with the resource group.** Follow demo 12's
separate cleanup instructions for its child agent, blueprint principal, blueprint,
and development credential. Also follow labs 14 and 23 for their separate
identity/credential and GitHub configuration cleanup.
