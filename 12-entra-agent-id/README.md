# Microsoft Agent Framework - What is Microsoft Entra Agent ID?

A tiny workshop tutor calls Foundry **as its own Entra Agent ID**, not as the
presenter. Show three things:

1. A **blueprint** is the parent template and holds the credential.
2. Its **child agent identity** is a special service principal with a sponsor.
   Its object ID and client ID are the same.
3. Bicep grants that child identity **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** on just
   this demo's Foundry account. The Agent Framework tutor uses its token.

This is a real Agent ID token exchange, not a renamed ordinary app registration.
There is no user delegation, Graph data access, agent user account, or hosted app.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+, Azure CLI with Bicep, and **PowerShell 7** (`pwsh`).
- A tenant with Entra Agent ID enabled and permission to create blueprints and
  agents, for example **Agent ID Developer**.
- An administrator able to consent to the explicit Graph delegated scopes in
  the setup script. Azure subscription Owner alone does not grant tenant rights.
- Azure resource creation/role-assignment permissions and `gpt-4.1-mini` quota.

The setup uses the supported Graph Agent ID APIs, including a beta endpoint for
child identity creation. Preview support/licensing and tenant policies may vary.
**Do not use Azure CLI tokens for Agent ID provisioning:** their Graph scopes can
be rejected by these APIs. The script uses `Connect-MgGraph` with explicit scopes.

## 1. Prepare the tenant identity (PowerShell)

From this demo folder, start an interactive PowerShell session and remain in it:

```powershell
pwsh
# Inside PowerShell:
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
./setup_identity.ps1 -TenantId "<tenant-id>"
```

The script signs in, uses the current user as owner/sponsor, creates the typed
blueprint, configures its identifier URI/scope, creates its blueprint principal,
creates the child agent, and adds a **one-day development-only blueprint secret**.
It sets these environment variables in the current PowerShell process:

- `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`
- `ENTRA_BLUEPRINT_CLIENT_ID`
- `ENTRA_AGENT_ID`
- `ENTRA_BLUEPRINT_SECRET`

Only non-secret IDs are saved to `.azure/identity.json`, including partial progress
for cleanup on failure. The secret/token is never printed or written to a file.
Do not enable PowerShell tracing/transcription or HTTP debug logging.
Run subsequent commands in this same session so child Python processes inherit
the variables. Rerunning setup with existing state fails rather than creating
duplicate identities.

Client secrets are for **local development only**. Production should use the
recommended identity SDK and managed identity federation or certificates with
proper token caching/refresh. The Python demo deliberately exposes Learn's two
short token requests for teaching; it acquires tokens for one short run only.

## 2. Deploy Azure infrastructure (same PowerShell session)

```powershell
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices --wait
$group = "rg-foundry-entra-agent-id-demo"
$presenter = az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
az group create --name $group --location eastus2
az deployment group create -g $group -n demo --template-file infra/main.bicep `
  --parameters "principalId=$presenter" "agentIdentityId=$env:ENTRA_AGENT_ID" location=eastus2
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = az deployment group show -g $group -n demo `
  --query properties.outputs.endpoint.value -o tsv
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = az deployment group show -g $group -n demo `
  --query properties.outputs.deployment.value -o tsv
```

Bicep creates a keyless Foundry account, `gpt-4.1-mini` deployment (`2025-04-14`,
Global Standard), account-scoped inference RBAC for the **child agent**, and Reader
for the presenter. Tenant objects aren't ARM resources, so their separate setup
is intentional; Bicep doesn't pretend to create them.

## 3. Run and present

```powershell
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./.venv/bin/python demo.py
```

These commands target macOS/Linux PowerShell. On Windows use
`./.venv/Scripts/python.exe` instead of `./.venv/bin/python`.

The script prints the blueprint and agent IDs, requests a blueprint exchange token
using `fmi_path`, exchanges it for the **child's** Cognitive Services token, and
passes that token to the Agent Framework OpenAI client. Foundry authorizes the
request using the agent's account-scoped role. Raw tokens are not displayed.
Open **Entra ID -> Agents** in the admin center to show the real blueprint,
child identity, sponsor, and sign-in activity (logs may take time to appear).

For a simple authorization contrast, inspect the role assignment: Reader alone
doesn't grant inference. This script never retries as the user or falls back to
an account key when the agent's request fails.

## Validate and troubleshoot

```powershell
az bicep build --file infra/main.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
az bicep lint --file infra/main.bicep
./.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Offline tests cover the two-stage token flow, credential errors, framework token
wiring, and a mocked execution of the PowerShell Graph setup. No tenant changes
are made by tests. Allow time for both Graph consent and Azure RBAC propagation.
403 at provisioning means check tenant scopes/roles; 403 at inference means check
the **agent's** role. After leaving the session, reuse the IDs and configure a new
blueprint credential securely; the script cannot recover the old secret.

## Cleanup (both Azure and tenant)

Deleting the resource group does **not** delete tenant identities. In the same
authenticated PowerShell session, an authorized blueprint owner/admin can run:

```powershell
az group delete --name $group --yes
$ids = Get-Content .azure/identity.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
# Only delete the objects whose IDs were recorded for this demo:
if ($ids.agentIdentityId) {
  Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method DELETE `
    -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/$($ids.agentIdentityId)"
}
if ($ids.blueprintPrincipalId) {
  Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method DELETE `
    -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/$($ids.blueprintPrincipalId)"
}
Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method DELETE `
  -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$($ids.blueprintObjectId)"
Remove-Item Env:ENTRA_BLUEPRINT_SECRET
```

If deletion requires additional tenant consent/roles, have the administrator
delete these recorded objects in the Entra admin center. After confirming cleanup,
remove only `.azure/identity.json` to permit a fresh setup. The one-day credential
must also be revoked if the blueprint is retained. Azure inference is billed;
the setup does not grant Graph application permissions.
