# 28 - Agent using a reusable Foundry skill

Store a reusable workshop procedure in the **preview Foundry Skills API**, pin
its immutable version, and use its downloaded instructions in a real Foundry
prompt agent. This follows the direct-injection concept from
[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/tools/skills).

## What to present

1. Open [the skill](./skills/workshop-brief/SKILL.md): YAML metadata describes when
   it applies; the body defines preparation, safe practice, cleanup, and an exact
   JSON output contract. No executable scripts are included.
2. Run [demo.py](./demo.py). It packages the file into a ZIP, gives the temporary
   skill a unique matching frontmatter/resource name, and uploads it to Foundry.
3. The harness downloads **that specific version**, not the mutable default,
   verifies its contents byte-for-byte in memory, and prints its version.
4. Two independent temporary agent versions receive the same title/model:
   first without the skill, then with its downloaded content added to system
   instructions. Both answers and actual token usage, when returned, are printed.
5. The skill-enabled answer must match every expected field/value with no extra
   fields. A missing marker, wrong title/checklist, invalid JSON, empty answer,
   incomplete response, or service failure exits nonzero.
6. Agent versions and the unique skill are deleted in `finally` blocks,
   including after download, inference, or validation failure.

This is **application-managed direct injection**, not autonomous discovery or a
native `skills=` option on a prompt agent. The agent executes in Foundry; the
Python harness runs locally. Skills supply reusable instructions, not new model
weights or executable tools. There is no Toolbox, MCP resource discovery,
progressive loading, hosted-container deployment, or GitHub token requirement.
The baseline is shown, not required to fail: generative output is variable and
this comparison is not a quality benchmark. The marker and checklist verify a
narrow instruction-following contract, not general correctness or safety.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+, Azure CLI with Bicep, and `az login` as an interactive user.
- Resource creation and role-assignment permissions for deployment.
- GPT-4.1-mini `2025-04-14` GlobalStandard availability and quota in your region.
- Foundry User (formerly Azure AI User) access, assigned at account scope by the
  template, covering its project and model.
- Preview Skills API support in the selected project/region. The SDK client uses
  `allow_preview=True` to enable preview operations/headers. A 400/404 indicating
  missing preview support is an error, not a reason to bypass skill storage and
  substitute local instructions.

Use only synthetic titles. Public networking is enabled for this workshop;
GlobalStandard processing may occur outside the resource region. API-key
authentication is disabled; `AzureCliCredential` uses your signed-in identity.

## Deploy and run

From the repository root, the existing runner discovers this folder:

```bash
az login
python3 deploy.py --subscription "<subscription-id>" --demo 28
```

The runner installs dependencies, runs offline tests, builds/deploys Bicep, and
executes the live demo. It consumes the existing `endpoint`, `deployment`, and
`projectEndpoint` output contracts; no runner changes are required.

Alternatively, from this folder:

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"
RG=rg-foundry-agent-skills-demo
LOCATION=eastus2
PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
az group create --name "$RG" --location "$LOCATION" --tags SecurityControl=Ignore SecurityExemption=StorageAccountKeyAccess
az deployment group create --name lab28 --resource-group "$RG" \
  --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters principalId="$PRINCIPAL_ID" location="$LOCATION"
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=$(az deployment group show -g "$RG" -n lab28 --query properties.outputs.projectEndpoint.value -o tsv)
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=$(az deployment group show -g "$RG" -n lab28 --query properties.outputs.deployment.value -o tsv)
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_demo.py' -v
python demo.py
python demo.py --title "Responsible AI workshop"
```

Use `--debug-response` to print the complete response JSON for troubleshooting.
RBAC propagation may take several minutes; 403 is an access error, 429 indicates
quota/rate limits, and unsupported model or preview operations remain errors.
Every successful live run makes two paid model requests. No invented token
counts or current-price estimates are reported. The template creates a dedicated
Foundry account, project, model deployment, and presenter role assignment with
the repository's required resource tags.

## Offline checks

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_demo.py' -v
az bicep build --file infra/main.bicep --stdout >/dev/null
```

Tests use SDK models and mocked service boundaries to check upload/download,
pinned version selection, unchanged prompts, injected instructions, exact output
validation, and cleanup on failures. These are not live Azure verification.

## Cleanup

Normal execution removes its temporary data-plane objects; infrastructure stays
deployed and can incur charges. If interrupted before cleanup completes, the
printed unique skill/agent names identify objects to remove in the project.
Do not delete someone else's objects in a shared project.

To remove this lab's dedicated resource group, confirm the subscription and name:

```bash
az group delete --subscription "<subscription-id>" --name rg-foundry-agent-skills-demo --yes --no-wait
```

The pinned `azure-ai-projects==2.7.0` SDK exposes `download_version`; some Learn
examples use `download_content` for the default version. This demo uses the
installed SDK's version-specific operation and never follows the default alias.
